Project Title :
CloudMediLink- A distributed Cloud based Information Management system

Project Description:
In many African countries, healthcare centers still rely on paper based records or isolated local databases which are not connected. this often result to lost of patient data, duplicated patient data or difficulties to retrieve data and doctors rarely have access to a patients complete medical history.
Therefore, patients are forced to repeat laboratory test and medical examinations whenever they visit a new hospital, leading to wasted time, higher costs and sometime incorrect diagnoses. 

To solve this challeng, my project CloudMediLink proposes a distributed cloud based healthcare information management system designed to unify and secure medical record across different healthcare centers. The platform uses distributed systems and cloud computing to ensure that patients information is accessible reliable and safely synchronized between participating institutions. It is built as a scalable, fault tolerant and collaborative solution that allows healthcare providers to share accurate data while maintaining patient privacy and system integrity

Problem description and scope:
The project focuses on the problem of fragmented patient data caused by disconnected healthcare center systems. Its scope includes public and private hospitals, clinics and community health centers looking to transit from paper based or stand alone systems to shared electronic health record WeekWeeks systems. The system will provide data input, retrieval and sharing across facilities while ensuring security confidentiality and compliance with medical data standards, thereby enhancing decision making, reduce redundant testing and improve healthcare continuity 

Proposed solution:
cloudMediLink  functions as a distributed healthcare network in which every hospital acts as a node connected to a central cloud platform. Each node retains local copies of its data but continuously synchronises with the cloud database, ensuring that updates are reflected in the whole system. This make the system fault tolerant. If one node or local server fails, others remain operational with replicated data which guarantees scalability, allowing new nodes to connect easily. The platform also promote collaboration by enabling by enabling doctors from different location to securely access shared patient files in real time 

system design and technologies:
•	Presentation layer: web or mobile interface for health care workers and administrators
•	Application layer: cloud hosted services built with node.js and express.js  to handle authentication, data processing and synchronization
•	Data layer: a distributed nosql database such as google firestore or aws dynamodb,

Project timeline (8 Weeks):
•	Weeks 1- 2:Requirement and system design.
•	Weeks 3-4:Cloud setup and database configuration.
•	Weeks 5-6:Backend and frontend development with API integration.
•	Weeks 7-8:System testing, documentation, and presentation.

Expected outcomes:
So by the end of this project a functional prototype will demonstrate how distribued and cloud based architectures can unify fragmented healthcare data into a secure efficient and collaborative platform
