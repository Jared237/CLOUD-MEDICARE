CLOUD-MEDICARE: A DISTRIBUTED HEALTH CARE DATA SERVICE ALSO PROVIDING HEALTH CARE DIAGNOSIS(CMC)

With CLOUD-MEDICARE(CMC), my aim is to ameliorate data management and analysis across Africa and Cameroon in particular with the use of distributed system and cloud computing 

Majority of Hospitals and clinics work independently and still use paper base systems to monitor and record patient history, making the search of this histories sometime long and stressfull when the patient has made a long period of time without consulting and is back for a consultation or is in another hospital or clinic where they are in need of this.

Cloud-MEDICARE provides a distributed electronic health record hosted on the cloud allowing real time sharing of patient’s information within authorized hospital, clinics and medical doctors

Some Key features:
•	Electronic Health record: patients’ medical histories are securely stored in the cloud accessible by any authorized doctor from any connected facility (e.g. home, hospital, clinic, healthcare centers)
